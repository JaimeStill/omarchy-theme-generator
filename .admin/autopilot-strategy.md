# Autopilot Development Strategy

## Overview
This document captures the autopilot development methodology established for accelerating the Omarchy Theme Generator project development while maintaining quality through agent-based peer review.

## Context
- **Date Established**: 2025-08-30
- **Branch**: `autopilot`
- **Purpose**: Speed-run remaining development with AI at the wheel
- **Key Principle**: Functionality over premature optimization

## Core Strategy

### Development Flow
```
Planning Mode → User Review → Auto-Accept Mode → Implementation → Validation → Finalization
```

### Phase Breakdown

#### 1. Planning Phase (10-15% of session time)
- Review session requirements from PROJECT.md
- Analyze existing codebase state
- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Submit comprehensive execution plan with milestones
- Request clarifications if needed

#### 2. Implementation Phase (60-70% of session time)
- Build functionality incrementally
- Use TodoWrite extensively for progress tracking
- Engage specialized agents for peer review at key points
- Test each component as it's built
- Focus on getting things working, not optimization

#### 3. Validation Phase (15-20% of session time)
- Run all execution tests
- Ensure 100% functionality (not performance benchmarks)
- Run `go vet ./...` for type checking
- Verify no regressions introduced

#### 4. Finalization Phase (5% of session time)
- Update PROJECT.md session log
- Update test documentation with outputs
- Document architectural decisions
- Prepare for next session

## Agent-Based Peer Review

### Available Specialized Agents
1. **go-engineer**: Expert Go engineer for idiomatic patterns and code quality
2. **color-science-specialist**: Color theory and algorithm validation
3. **docs-consistency-checker**: Documentation alignment and consistency

### Review Protocol
```
Implementation Step
    ↓
Agent Review (if applicable)
    ↓
Test Execution
    ↓
Fix Issues (if any)
    ↓
Next Step
```

### When to Engage Agents
- **go-engineer**: After implementing any significant Go infrastructure
- **color-science-specialist**: When implementing color algorithms or palette generation
- **docs-consistency-checker**: After updating documentation or before finalization

## Key Decisions

### Functionality Over Performance
- Get working code first
- Performance optimization deferred to final phase
- No premature benchmarking during development
- Focus on correctness and test passing

### Incremental Validation
- Test as you go, not all at end
- Early failure detection and resolution
- Each component validated before moving on
- Prevents cascading failures

### Documentation Trail
- Every session updates PROJECT.md
- Test outputs captured in README files
- Architectural decisions documented
- Clear handoff for next session

## Success Criteria

A session is successful when:
- [ ] All planned functionality implemented
- [ ] All execution tests pass
- [ ] Code follows Go idioms (validated by go-engineer)
- [ ] Color science accurate (validated by specialist)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] Session log in PROJECT.md updated

## Infrastructure Created

### prompts/session-autopilot.md
Self-contained prompt for autopilot sessions including:
- Quick start template
- Complete process overview
- Agent review protocol
- Success criteria checklist
- No dependencies on other prompts

### Key Features
- **Self-contained**: All instructions in one prompt
- **Agent-driven quality**: Peer reviews at critical points
- **Functionality focus**: Working code over optimization
- **Incremental validation**: Test progressively

## Session Initialization Template

```markdown
I'm starting Session [N]: [Session Title] in autopilot mode on the autopilot branch.

Please:
1. Start in plan mode
2. Review the session requirements from PROJECT.md
3. Create a comprehensive execution plan
4. Request any clarifications needed
5. Once I approve, I'll place you in auto-accept mode to implement

Focus on functionality over performance optimization. Use agent peer reviews at key implementation points.
```

## Rationale

### Why Autopilot?
- Project architecture is well-established
- Clear roadmap in PROJECT.md
- Comprehensive testing strategy defined
- Time and energy constraints on manual development

### Why Agent Review?
- Maintains quality without manual oversight
- Specialized validation for different domains
- Catches issues early in development
- Provides confidence in autonomous execution

### Why Functionality First?
- Working code is the primary goal
- Performance can be optimized later
- Prevents getting stuck on premature optimization
- Aligns with project's deferred testing philosophy

## Risk Mitigation

### Isolated Branch
- Development on `autopilot` branch
- Main branch preserved as fallback
- Easy reversion if approach fails

### Incremental Testing
- Continuous validation during development
- Early detection of issues
- Prevents accumulation of bugs

### Agent Validation
- Multiple perspectives on code quality
- Domain-specific expertise applied
- Peer review without human intervention

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Accelerated Development**: Complete sessions faster with auto-accept mode
2. **Maintained Quality**: Agent reviews ensure code standards
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: All changes tracked and documented
4. **Working Software**: Functional code prioritized over perfect code

## Future Enhancements Considered

Additional agents that could be valuable (but not implemented):
- **test-execution-validator**: Ensure all tests pass with targets
- **architecture-consistency-checker**: Validate design patterns
- **wcag-compliance-validator**: Verify accessibility standards

These were deemed unnecessary for initial autopilot implementation, focusing instead on core functionality with existing agents.
