# Palette Strategies & Theme Modes Test

## Overview
Comprehensive integration test of the theme generation system, validating the complete workflow from image extraction through palette synthesis to theme creation with WCAG compliance.

## Purpose
This test validates the Session 5 theme orchestration implementation that integrates all components:

- **Theme Generation Workflow**: Complete extraction → pipeline → theme generation
- **Mode Detection Logic**: WCAG-accurate light/dark mode classification
- **Override Validation System**: User color overrides with automatic WCAG adjustment
- **Performance Maintenance**: Verifies sub-2s target for 4K images is maintained
- **Computational Graphics Integration**: Validates integration with generative system

## Usage
```bash
go run tests/test-palette-strategies/main.go
```

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Core Theme Generation Workflow
Tests theme generation with different image types:
- 4K Synthetic images
- Grayscale images (requiring synthesis fallback)
- Monochromatic images (single hue variations)
- 80s Synthwave aesthetic images

### Test 2: Light/Dark Mode Detection
Validates mode detection accuracy with:
- Bright gradient images
- Dark interface designs
- Mid-tone industrial aesthetics
- Pure grayscale images

### Test 3: Override Validation System
Tests user color override scenarios:
- Valid high contrast overrides
- Poor contrast overrides requiring adjustment
- Dark theme specific overrides

### Test 4: Performance Target Validation
Benchmarks 4K image processing:
- Multiple iterations for average performance
- Target: <2 seconds
- Expected: ~266ms (7.5x faster than target)

### Test 5: Computational Graphics Integration
Validates integration with generative aesthetics:
- Cassette futurism interfaces
- Material simulation detection
- Accent hue preservation

## Expected Results
- ✅ All theme generation tests should complete successfully
- ✅ Mode detection should identify appropriate light/dark modes
- ✅ Override validation should automatically adjust for WCAG compliance
- ✅ Performance should remain 7.5x faster than 2s target
- ✅ Computational graphics should integrate seamlessly
