## Implementation Notes

### Simplification Principles
1. **Use standard library types** where possible (`color.RGBA`)
2. **Only build what's needed** - no speculative features
3. **Settings over hardcoding** - all thresholds configurable
4. **Clear dependency layers** - each package has specific purpose
5. **Purpose-driven organization** - role-based over frequency-based

## Completed Features

### Foundation Work (Initial Development)
- ✅ Project structure and Go module setup
- ✅ Initial color type implementation (refactored to pkg/formats)
- ✅ Color space conversions (RGB↔HSL, WCAG, LAB, XYZ)
- ✅ Image loading and validation infrastructure
- ✅ Multi-strategy extraction system (frequency vs saliency)
- ✅ Strategy selection based on image characteristics
- ✅ Settings-driven configuration with empirical thresholds

### Architectural Decisions Made
- **RGBA with cached HSLA**: Chosen over pure HSL for performance

- **Vocabulary precision**: IsGrayscale vs IsMonochromatic with proper definitions
- **Early termination algorithms**: 80% threshold for monochromatic detection
- **CLI-first architecture**: Optional TUI enhancement in future
- **HEXA color format**: For theme-gen.json metadata preservation

## Testing Strategy

## Development Log

### Documentation Updates (In Progress)
- Restructured PROJECT.md with component-based organization
- Created comprehensive architecture documentation
- Established glossary for technical terminology
- Updating cross-references across all documentation
- Aligning all docs with refactored architecture and actual implementation

### Architecture Refactoring Phase 1 (Structure Complete)
- ✅ Replaced custom Color type with standard library color.RGBA
- ✅ Converted from method-based to functional approach  
- ✅ Implemented HSLA type with full alpha channel support
- ✅ Added WCAG accessibility calculations with proper types
- ✅ Created color analysis utilities in pkg/formats
- ✅ Created pkg/chromatic for color theory foundation
- ✅ Created pkg/settings with Viper integration
- ✅ Created pkg/loader for image I/O
- ✅ Started pkg/analysis extraction from extractor
- ⏳ Unit tests for all new packages in development

**Key Decisions:**
- Use color.RGBA as foundation type across entire codebase
- Implement HSLA as separate type that implements color.Color interface
- Organize tests by package rather than flat structure
- Focus on functional approach over method-based design
